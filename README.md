<h1>Hi! I'm mindfulvector and this is mvLibrary!</h1>

Not much to show here yet BUT there is a pretty simple Delphi FireMoney Component example. It doesn't actually DO anything other than inherit from TPanel. It will in the future take on the code from my TSCN-Parser project, also on Github, to publish as a component. I also plan to release additional components in the future if I'm able to write anything useful.
